          <p>
            Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human
            brain, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.
            They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," where
            each node processes input data, applies weights, biases, and
            activation functions to produce an output. These layers are
            typically organized into three types: input, hidden, and output
            layers. Neural networks learn by adjusting weights during training
            using algorithms like backpropagation to minimize the error between
            predicted and actual outputs. They are widely used in applications
            such as image recognition, natural language processing, and
            autonomous systems due to their ability to model non-linear
            relationships in data.
